            <h1>PROSE</h1>
            <p>Prose, natural and clear either written or spoken, 
                non-rhythmic progression of words carefully chosen, 
                the lesson deprived of poetic timing, dull and 
                plainly expressed yet sometimes no less exciting.</p>

                    Deep inside her mind, it's a book of nightmares open wide,<br>
                    You think it's cool when you read her story, but have you read between the lines,<br>
                    The way that twists turns, and trouble all get into her head,<br>
                    It would make you wish you didn't have to go to bed,<br>
                    The terrors in her mind only bring back memories that she dreads,<br>
                    Wishing she could die or run away never to be seen again,<br>
                    The only thing she's ever wanted is for people to understand,<br>
                    But she can only explain to you what it's like by saying,<br>
                    <br>
                    "My blade's a little bloody red,<br>
                    Tears in my eyes as I lay awakened in my bed,<br>
                    It's from all the craziness and the mistakes I've ever made,<br>
                    And now trying to love will never be the same,<br>
                    My thighs and my wrists show the misunderstandings those people gave me,<br>
                    Why say I'm perfect, then turn around and try to change me?<br>
                    I try to stop it and open up, but what I do is not enough,<br>
                    Now I'm just living in this cycle, faking smiles and acting tough."<br>
                    <br>
                    I've got nervous ticks from what myself inside my head just said,<br>
                    When I, too, was being pinned, cornered, and played by my consciousness,<br>
                    I said how can you expect others to understand you if you can't understand yourself,<br>
                    Those words were loaded into a gun and I had shot myself,<br>
                    I was face down in an underground library with only books of truth left,<br>
                    Walking my days as a stray with tunnel vision while speaking to no one else,<br>
                    Destination unknown,<br>
                    Taking giant leaps to make baby steps,<br>
                    It's come to the point where I understand not a thing except,<br>
                    <br>
                    "My blade's a little bloody red,<br>
                    Tears in my eyes as I lay awakened in my bed,<br>
                    It's from all the craziness and the mistakes I've ever made,<br>
                    And now trying to love will never be the same,<br>
                    My thighs and my wrists show the misunderstandings those people gave me,<br>
                    Why say I'm perfect, then turn around and try to change me?<br>
                    I try to stop it and open up, but what I do is not enough,<br>
                    Now I'm just living in this cycle, faking smiles and acting tough."
