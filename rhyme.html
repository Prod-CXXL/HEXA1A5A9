            <h1>RHYME</h1>
            <p>Rhyme, the repetition of characters portraying themes and moods, words turned to silent tunes, 
                stories emphasized with feeling over alliterations, a continuation of meanings resonating in 
                our heads, sounds of the alphabet like this or that in a way you won't forget, but the views 
                and aspects are forever yours to dissect.</p>

                        <p>I put all my ducks in a row,<br>
                            Lead them to water, they drank,<br>
                            Yet ate bread from another hand,<br>
                            And now I’m all out my bread,<br>
                            So I’ve come to the conclusion,<br>
                            That this make believe fairy tale,<br>           
                            Was more rabbit hole than wonderland,<br>            
                            And even though,<br>            
                            The fruit and flowers were fabulous,<br>            
                            They were faux, fictitious, and fabricated,<br>           
                            And once I figured it all out,<br>            
                            Things exacerbated,<br>            
                            I was watching flames in the frozen forest,<br>            
                            As far as the eyes could see,<br>            
                            I didn’t believe,<br>            
                            As the horse became man,<br>            
                            And the since deceased birds and bees,<br>            
                            Pollinated a purple tree,<br>            
                            Which grew purple leaves,<br>            
                            With purple fruit,<br>            
                            That unsurprisingly had purple seeds,<br>            
                            Soon, I realized I had been oblivious to true existential means,<br>            
                            I had done it all,<br>            
                            But what did I do at all,<br>            
                            Just to set me off like a bomb,<br>           
                            Middle finger to me when I see that I’m the killer,<br>           
                            Because I don’t know what’s worse,<br>           
                            Flaming Butterflies<br>

                        <p>In my mind, it's "Do or Die",<br>
                            We're losing time,<br> 
                            On my watch, I see ten 'o five,<br>
                            Drooping eyes,<br>
                            Surfacing what was once deep inside,<br>
                            Promises broken and government lies,<br>
                            If there's nothing to worry about,<br>
                            Why are we still struggling to stay alive,<br>
                            What was once knee high,<br>
                            Is now waist-high,<br>
                            Racing up your backside,<br>
                            Memory's fading,<br>
                            Hope is dying,<br>
                            Pulling from my mind what I despise,<br>
                            Though last in line, I'm first to cry,<br>
                            Sorrows and weeping because all can die,<br>
                            What I'm saying is not a lie,<br>
                            I'm just trying to get you to see eye to eye..<br>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>They say once you've hit rock bottom, the only way left is up.<br>
                            I negated this seemingly unquestionable thought. I said to myself, "What if I am rock bottom?"<br>
                            What if I am rock bottom like that's not my position,<br>
                            Things are weighted on me and my lovers leave with or without my permission,<br>
                            I'm missing,<br>
                            Nonexistent,<br>
                            I'm invisible and inaudible,<br>
                            But even if they could hear,<br>
                            They'd never listen,<br>
                            A splitting image of good, talented, and gifted,<br>
                            But no one gives a shit,<br>
                            The only voice I truly have is my cranium, but it's lifted,<br>
                            My head was peeled off and completely twisted,<br>
                            Tweaked, then placed back with a chip in,<br>
                            It causes me to overthink and engage as if to be a menace,<br>
                            The problem is I think that I probably did it,<br>
                            Just to try and fit in,<br>
                            And feel normal and funny like the other kids,<br>
                            I wanted happiness,<br>
                            Not more pain and reminiscences,<br>
                            And ponderous premonitions,<br>
                            Sometimes I feel like this would be good riddance if I end this and be finished,<br>
                            But I forgot to mention,<br>
                            Without me as rock bottom with good potential and intentions,<br>
                            No one would ever rise back to the top after falling into to the depths of my trenches...<br>

                        <p>I thought she had my back,<br>
                            But I’m still looking for the other side of me,<br>
                            They tell me to keep my head up,<br>
                            But it’s my body that’s drooping honestly,<br>
                            This girl broke the lock from the last girl that broke the key,<br>
                            Then she took my heart out, left me like a shell, and got me empty,<br>
                            Now, I’m cold and frozen over like the Arctic used to be,<br>
                            Reminiscing painfully,<br>
                            Mourning over your memories,<br>
                            I wish that probably if some girl would just call me,<br>
                            That she would take anything more off of me,<br>
                            I want to sleep just for somebody to call me,<br>
                            When the coast is clear and nobody else would rob me,<br>
                            But in this mind-state you see me in,<br>
                            Chaos from the beginning to the end,<br>
                            Like,<br>
                            Girls thieving out their minds,<br>
                            But they ain’t gotta do no time,<br>
                            Saying “Yeah, they understand”,<br>
                            When really they don’t give a damn,<br>
                            Is that a crime or is a women’s logic everywhere,<br>
                            Trying to find love, but girls keep on telling fairy tales,<br>
                            Stab me in the back and I think she should go to jail,<br>
                            New girl says she loves me, but she gon’ have to swear,<br>
                            Love is everywhere,<br>
                            So keep me in your prayers,<br>
                            Do you really care or was this a truth or dare,<br>
                            Now, I’m frozen, stone cold frozen,<br>
                            Looking at me with your eyes full of poison,<br>
                            Before then, you weren’t in my brain and it was silent..<br>

                            Snoozing on your texts, Nothing moving,<br>
                            You're still choosing,<br>

                            I'm sorry that I couldn't be what you wanted me to be,<br>
                            Because I'm me and finally I'll be free,<br>
                            Freer than you've ever seen,<br>
                            Because I'm gone,<br>
                            In the blink of an eye,<br>
                            Is this really what you want?<br>

                            Hence the silence,<br>
                            I am the face unseen,<br>
                            I have no eyelids,<br>
                            I am the trend unworn,<br>
                            No color or pattern,<br>
                            I am the unshaken hand,<br>
                            Of Sadness or Laughter,<br>
                            Decisions and deals,<br>
                            The bad or the good,<br>
                            I am hearts healed,<br>
                            And equally hearts broken,<br>
                            I am the body dead,<br>
                            Or yet grown,<br>

                        <p>This is the opposite of a eulogy for me and you,<br>
                            Once together forever, but that time isn’t coming soon,<br>
                            You grabbed a noose and hung me in the closet and locked it, inescapable,<br>
                            Like an old sweater you’ll never wear cuz it’s too ugly and itchy, uncomfortable,<br>
                            Well now I’m back, resurfaced,<br>
                            Like I’m upchucking all of my problems,<br>
                            Spaghetti on walls if I were to solve em’,<br>
                            I hate that you couldn’t see I was trying my hardest,<br>
                            I was waiting for you when you said school was the problem,<br>
                            But you left me on Earth while you readied your rocket,<br>
                            We had magical moments that were better than Disney,<br>
                            Now, I’m walking into rooms with elixirs and neon daily,<br>
                            How does all of the love we perfected turn into a love we regretted,<br>
                            Or how can you turn and forget it,<br>
                            Or not feel the pain of the lesson,<br>
                            The past is a haunting pathetic,<br>
                            Now, I’m dead inside because all the pieces you took of me are neglected,<br>
                            How can she not remember what we had from beginning to ending,<br>
                            But there was really no ending,<br>
                            Just an abrupt decision to send me,<br>
                            Back into the Hell from which you say I ascended..<br>

                            Disconnected, but together like a train,<br>
                            I might be losing my little bit of sane,<br>
                            I’m ready to get up with my things and walk away,<br>
                            I’ve been nicked and scraped and bruised and cut then burnt,<br>
                            Buried alive then dug back up to be asked if I was hurt,<br>
                            My mind’s like crumbled paper and broken bottles,<br>
                            Losing worth,<br>
                            All this talent so I thought I found myself,<br>
                            Yet still I’m on that search,<br>
                            Looking for a better state of mind,<br>
                            My mind is filled with its own rage,<br>
                            Sharp, but dangerous like a dull blade,<br>
                            They say I’m always going down the wrong path or that it’s dark,<br>
                            They only say that because it’s my own way,<br>
                            I’ve been doing this from the start..<br>

                        You're the campfire dancing under bokeh lights,<br>
                        You're the soft whispers of the wildlife,<br>
                        You're the cocoa I sip whilst peering into your eyes,<br>
                        You're the Borealis over marshmallows,<br>
                        With your head on my shoulder,<br>
                        Watching our time, our minds, the comets, and worries,<br>
                        Just drift away with each zephyr slowly,<br>
                        You're the sweet susurration held true of yore,<br>
                        You're everything so beautiful and more,<br>
                        And I love you.<br>

                        And then I found you so astonishing,<br>
                        That I compliment you with every thought,<br>
                        <br>
                        Oh my! Your eyes!<br>
                        How beautiful and delicate they are to me,<br>
                        “Perfect!”, your Creator must’ve said,<br>

                        And your laugh!<br>
                        Happily, I replay it over and over in my head,<br>
                        Oh, what I would do to hear it again,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        What a personality!<br>
                        Never dull, lifeless, or bland,<br>
                        When I’m around you, my heart and mind shake hands,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        Such a smile!<br>
                        So precious like diamonds and beach sand,<br>
                        How you stole it from an angel is something I have yet to comprehend,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        Then your voice!<br>
                        How sweet and soothing,<br>
                        5 stars! Would highly recommend,<br>
                        Like an Angel’s soft touch on my heart,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        Moments, minutes, seconds gone by,<br>
                        Since I’ve seen or heard you,<br>
                        Yet, I can sense vibrance of your soul’s lights,<br>
                        You just can help being a star, can you?<br>
                        <br>
                        So think here as I stand,<br>
                        Admiring all about you,<br>
                        Do you think the reason you’re so perfect and beautiful?,<br>
                        Is because you’re the Creator’s Stencil?<br>
