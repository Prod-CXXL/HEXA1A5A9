            <h1>RHYME</h1>
            <p>Rhyme, the repetition of characters portraying themes and moods, words turned to silent tunes, 
                stories emphasized with feeling over alliterations, a continuation of meanings resonating in 
                our heads, sounds of the alphabet like this or that in a way you won't forget, but the views 
                and aspects are forever yours to dissect.</p>

                        <p>I put all my ducks in a row,<br>
                            Lead them to water, they drank,<br>
                            Yet ate bread from another hand,<br>
                            And now I’m all out my bread,<br>
                            So I’ve come to the conclusion,<br>
                            That this make believe fairy tale,<br>           
                            Was more rabbit hole than wonderland,<br>            
                            And even though,<br>            
                            The fruit and flowers were fabulous,<br>            
                            They were faux, fictitious, and fabricated,<br>           
                            And once I figured it all out,<br>            
                            Things exacerbated,<br>            
                            I was watching flames in the frozen forest,<br>            
                            As far as the eyes could see,<br>            
                            I didn’t believe,<br>            
                            As the horse became man,<br>            
                            And the since deceased birds and bees,<br>            
                            Pollinated a purple tree,<br>            
                            Which grew purple leaves,<br>            
                            With purple fruit,<br>            
                            That unsurprisingly had purple seeds,<br>            
                            Soon, I realized I had been oblivious to true existential means,<br>            
                            I had done it all,<br>            
                            But what did I do at all,<br>            
                            Just to set me off like a bomb,<br>           
                            Middle finger to me when I see that I’m the killer,<br>           
                            Because I don’t know what’s worse,<br>           
                            Flaming Butterflies<br>           
                            Or Melting Caterpillars..<br>

                        <p>In my mind, it's "Do or Die",<br>
                            We're losing time,<br> 
                            On my watch, I see ten 'o five,<br>
                            Drooping eyes,<br>
                            Surfacing what was once deep inside,<br>
                            Promises broken and government lies,<br>
                            If there's nothing to worry about,<br>
                            Why are we still struggling to stay alive,<br>
                            What was once knee high,<br>
                            Is now waist-high,<br>
                            Racing up your backside,<br>
                            Memory's fading,<br>
                            Hope is dying,<br>
                            Pulling from my mind what I despise,<br>
                            Though last in line, I'm first to cry,<br>
                            Sorrows and weeping because all can die,<br>
                            What I'm saying is not a lie,<br>
                            I'm just trying to get you to see eye to eye..<br>
                        </p>

                    <button class="poem-title">ROCK BOTTOM <span class="arrow">&#9660;</span></button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>They say once you've hit rock bottom, the only way left is up.<br>
                            I negated this seemingly unquestionable thought. I said to myself, "What if I am rock bottom?"<br>
                            What if I am rock bottom like that's not my position,<br>
                            Things are weighted on me and my lovers leave with or without my permission,<br>
                            I'm missing,<br>
                            Nonexistent,<br>
                            I'm invisible and inaudible,<br>
                            But even if they could hear,<br>
                            They'd never listen,<br>
                            A splitting image of good, talented, and gifted,<br>
                            But no one gives a shit,<br>
                            The only voice I truly have is my cranium, but it's lifted,<br>
                            My head was peeled off and completely twisted,<br>
                            Tweaked, then placed back with a chip in,<br>
                            It causes me to overthink and engage as if to be a menace,<br>
                            The problem is I think that I probably did it,<br>
                            Just to try and fit in,<br>
                            And feel normal and funny like the other kids,<br>
                            I wanted happiness,<br>
                            Not more pain and reminiscences,<br>
                            And ponderous premonitions,<br>
                            Sometimes I feel like this would be good riddance if I end this and be finished,<br>
                            But I forgot to mention,<br>
                            Without me as rock bottom with good potential and intentions,<br>
                            No one would ever rise back to the top after falling into to the depths of my trenches...<br>

                        <p>It’s getting harder and harder to sleep,<br>
                            Even when I don’t hear a peep,<br>
                            Cupid was stupid and killed all my sheep,<br>
                            A nuisance that’s better in dreams...<br>

                            Visible,<br>

                            I'm fanned away,<br>
                            The more and more my leaving's provoked,<br>
                            The more and more I become non-existent,<br>
                            My life is a cloud of smoke...<br>

                        <p>I thought she had my back,<br>
                            But I’m still looking for the other side of me,<br>
                            They tell me to keep my head up,<br>
                            But it’s my body that’s drooping honestly,<br>
                            This girl broke the lock from the last girl that broke the key,<br>
                            Then she took my heart out, left me like a shell, and got me empty,<br>
                            Now, I’m cold and frozen over like the Arctic used to be,<br>
                            Reminiscing painfully,<br>
                            Mourning over your memories,<br>
                            I wish that probably if some girl would just call me,<br>
                            That she would take anything more off of me,<br>
                            I want to sleep just for somebody to call me,<br>
                            When the coast is clear and nobody else would rob me,<br>
                            But in this mind-state you see me in,<br>
                            Chaos from the beginning to the end,<br>
                            Like,<br>
                            Girls thieving out their minds,<br>
                            But they ain’t gotta do no time,<br>
                            Saying “Yeah, they understand”,<br>
                            When really they don’t give a damn,<br>
                            Is that a crime or is a women’s logic everywhere,<br>
                            Trying to find love, but girls keep on telling fairy tales,<br>
                            Stab me in the back and I think she should go to jail,<br>
                            New girl says she loves me, but she gon’ have to swear,<br>
                            Love is everywhere,<br>
                            So keep me in your prayers,<br>
                            Do you really care or was this a truth or dare,<br>
                            Now, I’m frozen, stone cold frozen,<br>
                            Looking at me with your eyes full of poison,<br>
                            Before then, you weren’t in my brain and it was silent..<br>
                            Now it's noisy, yeah,<br>
                            Playing leapfrog with my thoughts in there,<br>
                            All this nonsense I forget it,<br>
                            I should've said no to you in the beginning,<br>
                            You're just losing, I'm just winning,<br>
                            Snoozing on your texts, Nothing moving,<br>
                            You're still choosing,<br>
                            But ain't not choice to be chosen because I'm through it like..<br>
                            Set me free from this ice.<br>

                            I can’t move on,<br>
                            I feel emotions coming on,<br>

                            To cure my pain and agony,<br>
                            It's like heartbreak, but a tragedy,<br>
                            And day after day, I’ve never felt it go away,<br>

                            Waiting for some other days,<br>
                            Thinking back on better times,<br>

                            Why?<br>
                            Do you do this to me?<br>
                            Why are we always arguing or bickering?<br>
                            Are you listening?<br>
                            You never thought this relationship was diminishing,<br>
                            Are you kidding me?<br>
                            How am I the enemy?<br>
                            Is this really what you think of me?<br>
                            Maybe it is me,<br>
                            I'm changing and I'm sorry that you didn't see,<br>
                            I'm sorry that I couldn't be what you wanted me to be,<br>
                            Because I'm me and finally I'll be free,<br>
                            Freer than you've ever seen,<br>
                            Because I'm gone,<br>
                            In the blink of an eye,<br>
                            Is this really what you want?<br>
                            Don't lie...<br>

                        <p>I am the voice unspoken,<br>
                            Hence the silence,<br>
                            I am the face unseen,<br>
                            I have no eyelids,<br>
                            I am the trend unworn,<br>
                            No color or pattern,<br>
                            I am the unshaken hand,<br>
                            Of Sadness or Laughter,<br>
                            Decisions and deals,<br>
                            The bad or the good,<br>
                            I am hearts healed,<br>
                            And equally hearts broken,<br>
                            I am the body dead,<br>
                            Or yet grown,<br>
                            I am the Unknown.<br>

                        <p>This is the opposite of a eulogy for me and you,<br>
                            Once together forever, but that time isn’t coming soon,<br>
                            You grabbed a noose and hung me in the closet and locked it, inescapable,<br>
                            Like an old sweater you’ll never wear cuz it’s too ugly and itchy, uncomfortable,<br>
                            Well now I’m back, resurfaced,<br>
                            Like I’m upchucking all of my problems,<br>
                            Spaghetti on walls if I were to solve em’,<br>
                            I hate that you couldn’t see I was trying my hardest,<br>
                            I was waiting for you when you said school was the problem,<br>
                            But you left me on Earth while you readied your rocket,<br>
                            We had magical moments that were better than Disney,<br>
                            Now, I’m walking into rooms with elixirs and neon daily,<br>
                            How does all of the love we perfected turn into a love we regretted,<br>
                            Or how can you turn and forget it,<br>
                            Or not feel the pain of the lesson,<br>
                            The past is a haunting pathetic,<br>
                            Now, I’m dead inside because all the pieces you took of me are neglected,<br>
                            How can she not remember what we had from beginning to ending,<br>
                            But there was really no ending,<br>
                            Just an abrupt decision to send me,<br>
                            Back into the Hell from which you say I ascended..<br>

                            I might be losing my little bit of sane,<br>
                            I’m ready to get up with my things and walk away,<br>
                            I’ve been nicked and scraped and bruised and cut then burnt,<br>
                            Buried alive then dug back up to be asked if I was hurt,<br>
                            My mind’s like crumbled paper and broken bottles,<br>
                            Losing worth,<br>
                            All this talent so I thought I found myself,<br>
                            Yet still I’m on that search,<br>
                            Looking for a better state of mind,<br>
                            My mind is filled with its own rage,<br>
                            Sharp, but dangerous like a dull blade,<br>
                            They say I’m always going down the wrong path or that it’s dark,<br>
                            They only say that because it’s my own way,<br>
                            I’ve been doing this from the start..<br>

                            Pain is a funny lil something,<br>
                            Funny by the way it keeps on coming,<br>
                            I lock it out and board the doors,<br>
                            Write a song to a couple chords,<br>
                            Trying to hide the mental sores,<br>
                            And it still comes in bombarding,<br>
                            Rushing, charging in like it was never forgotten,<br>
                            Bottled up and discarded,<br>
                            Shot into space on top of a rocket,<br>
                            Sometimes I even try to stuff it in my pockets,<br>
                            That was in the beginning,<br>
                            When my mind wasn't so crowded, but empty,<br>
                            And it seems life was good in that century,<br>
                            Until reality hit me,<br>
                            It took a dagger and nicked me,<br>
                            Left an ugly wound and said, "Remember me?",<br>
                            And you know, I surely did,<br>
                            Shake my head trying to say "no" to the meds,<br>
                            Leaving me to pain, but hoping for loving instead...

                        I'm warning you right now that I'm going to make a mistake,<br>
                        The choice I've been given is one that I will never be ready to make,<br>
                        Every second of the hour, I'm thinking about the risks and what it would take,<br>
                        Will it make me happier? And will you be okay?,<br>
                        Will this mistake come to haunt me? And will I then be afraid?,<br>
                        Will I breakdown in tears thinking about you one night?,<br>
                        Will you ever forgive me for my mistakes and turn on alright?,<br>
                        I bet you'll lie to me and tell me that you're okay,<br>
                        When you really are hurt inside thinking that I used you for something other than your love or your brain,<br>
                        All you have to trust me with is my words because we aren't close enough to prove a thing,<br>
                        One time, that a conquerable distance grew up pain and that pain grew a silent violence,<br>
                        That silent violence raged into a separation that kept the quiet,<br>
                        Really wishing it wasn't life like this,<br>
                        And when I dream, I never dreamt of it quite like this,<br>
                        And why'd the thought come forth in such a night like this?,<br>
                        Darling, I love you and sorry for this...

                        I remember the time I experienced a rare love,<br>
                        A love so beautiful, we were both content we were enough,<br>
                        To satisfy our every need, never holding back anything,<br>
                        Even if we weren't together, we would spend the night in a dream,<br>
                        It felt as though nothing would happen as long as we stayed clean,<br>
                        Called each other baby even when we were angry,<br>
                        It was the same lovely things over and over again,<br>
                        But it was everything to us. You and I. We,<br>
                        Were so perfect. It seemed nothing would ever sever you from me,<br>
                        It seemed like nothing could ever come in between,<br>
                        It was all an illusion high at its peak,<br>
                        Blind is he or I who didn't see the past, go back, and freeze,<br>
                        Like a mannequin figurine. High as a kite off his dreams,<br>
                        Built from the things he believed were true,<br>
                        Because honesty is key and patience is a virtue,<br>
                        So time flew by and he finally was able to come from under the stage,<br>
                        Draw the curtains and look you in the face,<br>
                        Hundreds of you. What a sight so phenomenal and great,<br>
                        But the anxiety grew and the fear seemed abominable,<br>
                        So much, I grew sick in my abdominal,<br>
                        Sick of pain, the mental and physical strain,<br>
                        But still calling to see if you're okay,<br>
                        Trying to take every mistake,<br>
                        Although we said it a hundred times a day,<br>
                        This one just didn't feel the same,<br>
                        Tears in my eyes because there's only one escape,<br>
                        Words that I never wished to say,<br>
                        I don't know how to say it in any other way,<br>
                        Now they echo in my brain,<br>
                        Leaving me awake at night to contemplate,<br>
                        Fearing I would see you in my dream,<br>
                        While still thinking back on the forever we believed,<br>
                        Then you say you hate me,<br>
                        Yet, I love you anyway...

                        I'm caught, captured, and grasped by so many things hard to explain,<br>
                        My brain is intricate and abstruse, but distant and screwed loose,<br>
                        I feel as though I have failed an unliving life without a purpose,<br>
                        The show's is not over, but all I see is closed curtains and it's hurting,<br>
                        I know that I shouldn't do this, but I'm walking with closed eyes and hands tied,<br>
                        My mouth is shut, so that I can speak no lies,<br>
                        I'm partially tongue tied,<br>
                        It's just as twisted as my cold life...

                        Like a tool to tell us to stay away and keep quiet,<br>
                        To limit all the violence,<br>
                        To further disable the old and the weak,<br>
                        To set the world ablaze without a fire...<br>
                        <br>
                        The social distancing is provoking and increasing my insanity,<br>
                        All the profanity wanting to rage out against the man in me,<br>
                        Unsatisfied with humanity,<br>
                        I'm looking in the mirror stiff and sturdy,<br>
                        Carrying these weights almost as if to be the vanity...<br>
                        <br>
                        What's the probability of my insanity,<br>
                        Coming in and stabbing me while I'm half asleep,<br>
                        This Corona virus is tragedy,<br>
                        Half a million dead in seven weeks,<br>
                        I can't leave the house or even go to sleep,<br>
                        Thinking back on days where I could talk to you happily,<br>
                        Now we're more than distant and I think you're mad at me,<br>
                        But I'm never mad at you because you are unique as a snowflake,<br>
                        I was looking forward to spending time with you,<br>
                        But with the world, it might be too late,<br>
                        And it's alright if it never happens,<br>
                        I just hope that you're okay...

                        And then I found you so astonishing,<br>

                        How beautiful and delicate they are to me,<br>

                        And your laugh!<br>

                        When I’m around you, my heart and mind shake hands,<br>

                        <br>
                        Such a smile!<br>
                        So precious like diamonds and beach sand,<br>
                        How you stole it from an angel is something I have yet to comprehend,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        Then your voice!<br>
                        How sweet and soothing,<br>
                        5 stars! Would highly recommend,<br>
                        Like an Angel’s soft touch on my heart,<br>
                        I think here as I stand,<br>
                        <br>
                        Moments, minutes, seconds gone by,<br>

                        Yet, I can sense vibrance of your soul’s lights,<br>
                        You just can help being a star, can you?<br>
                        <br>
                        So think here as I stand,<br>

                        I know you so well, I can sense when you are near,<br>
                        Every time I talk to you, you fix one of my mind's damaged gears,<br>
                        When good memories are directed here, I only cry for you joyous tears...

                        <br>
                        Your skin starts to swell,<br>
                        Worms seem to love on your face,<br>
                        That's when you say,<br>
                        That's more than I did for you, babe,<br>
                        <br>
                        That put me in rage,<br>
                        I throw dirt in your face,<br>
                        You killed me inside,<br>
                        By just spewing those lies,<br>
                        <br>
                        And I'll never hurt you,<br>
                        Not like you did to me,<br>
                        So let's end this right now,<br>
                        Lay me so cold and comfy,<br>
                        <br>
                        I tasted the blade<br>
                        It tastes like our blood,<br>
                        You say I'm insane,<br>
                        I wish that I was,<br>
                        <br>
                        Maybe I wouldn't be,<br>
                        So (damn) in love with you,<br>
                        Trying to think who you were,<br>
                        To be beaten by me,<br>
                        <br>
                        You can't afford me a box,<br>
                        But that is okay,<br>
                        You like seeing my face,<br>
                        Even though it will change,<br>
                        <br>
                        My skin starts to swell,<br>
                        Bugs chew on my flesh,<br>
                        That's when you say,<br>
                        I'm sorry for this, babe..

                        1,452 hurts<br>
                        Your mind cannot render me<br>
                        I am unfathomable<br>
                        I'd rather you end me<br>
                        Let's keep a tally of<br>
                        All of the times you thought I was incapable<br>
                        And I took it to heart, now my joy is untraceable<br>
                        All of the times you made my life worse<br>
                        And continued to inflict regardless of hurts<br>
                        Your words are a flame and my thoughts are combustible<br>
                        I have no friends, I ask you to stop, you think it's laughable<br>
                        You hit me, kick me, push me around<br>
                        You tease me, taunt me, make me the clown<br>
                        I try to make peace, you say that I'm weak and a fool<br>
                        I tell an adult, but I get they're children and that's what they do<br>
                        You wanted a life in which I was one under you?<br>
                        Well now you've got it, don't think I lay comfortable<br>
                        Your mind cannot render me<br>
                        I am unfathomable<br>
                        Your doings have ended me<br>
                        I kept a tally of<br>
                        All of the things you thought I was incapable<br>
                        And I took it to heart now my body's untraceable<br>
                        All of the times you made my life worse<br>
                        Now painless I lie six feet in the dirt<br>
                        0 hurts

                    <p>
                        Hey, my name is Hex,<br>
                        But you can call me suicidal,<br>
                        I wrote you this letter while on drugs,<br>
                        That's the new meaning of a high note,<br>
                        Before you ask me any questions,<br>
                        Yes, I'm falling down a spiral,<br>
                        The double helix that I'm bleeding got be checking on my vitals,<br>
                        Viral like videos of Michael,<br>
                        That's what every kid wants to be it seems,<br>
                        Or at least the ones that I know,<br>
                        <br>
                        They’ll say I’m crazy when I deck ‘em,<br>
                        But check my records, it’s my title,<br>
                        You can see it’s clearly in my blood,<br>
                        And everyone will get like it’s Type-O,<br>
                        <br>
                        My mind is on the ceiling, spinning around like vinyl,<br>
                        But I still can't scratch the surface of who I really am inside though,<br>
                        Producing a bit of music for the vicinity<br>
                        To tune in<br>
                        But then screw back on my head just before I’m about lose it,<br>
                        I think I’m so distraught that if I think another thought,<br>
                        Never mind, wait, wait a sec, Is this a paradox?<br>
                        I don’t even know, because either way my life sucks,<br>
                        Oh, now walks in my demons, Hello, hello, What’s up?,<br>
                        <br>
                        She agreed to love me,<br>
                        That agrees to fight my demons and me,<br>
                        See? I'm not as perfect as I might seem,<br>
                        I poured bleach all on my clothes, so more than just my veins could bleed,<br>
                        <br>
                        And more than just my smile would fade,<br>
                        I lay here in silence, stuck between my demons and my mental state,<br>
                        Wishing I could run away,<br>
                        Off to find my happy place…

                        What is sleepy time to the boy that can't close his eyes?<br>
                        What is truth to the boy who has to live off of lies?<br>
                        What is love to the boy whose pain will never subside?<br>
                        What is hope to the boy who always spends his night crying?<br>
                        Laying awake,<br>
                        Watching the day bleed into another day,<br>
                        Wishing all his woes away,<br>
                        I don't think you understand the pain this kid goes through every day,<br>
                        And all you do is give a "ha ha ha ha" right to his face,<br>
                        <br>
                        But if he disappears, what would you say?<br>
                        If he just disappears, what would the new say?<br>
                        If he just disappears, would you finally feel his pain?<br>
                        Because suicidal is a new name,<br>
                        <br>
                        This girl, she wears makeup and dresses to impress,<br>
                        Hides her insecurities, yet she still gets called a mess,<br>
                        People are packing on her stress,<br>
                        They are messing with her head,<br>
                        It doesn't matter what she says,<br>
                        No one ever calls it quits,<br>
                        Now it's a moonlit sky and it's starting to get dense,<br>
                        She lights up her essence as her poison's swallowed thick,<br>
                        <br>
                        Then it intensifies and she's carving out her thighs,<br>
                        It all happened overnight,<br>
                        Her only battle is to live or die,<br>
                        Now she bleeds in the shadows under moonlight,<br>
                        Because whatever you said you should've thought twice,<br>
                        <br>
                        But if she disappears, what would you say?<br>
                        If she just disappears, what would the new say?<br>
                        If she just disappears, would you finally feel her pain?<br>
                        Because suicidal is a new name.

                        Deep inside her mind, it's a book of nightmares open wide,<br>
                        You think it's cool when you read her story, but have you read between the lines,<br>
                        The way that twists turns, and trouble all get into her head,<br>
                        It would make you wish you didn't have to go to bed,<br>
                        The terrors in her mind only bring back memories that she dreads,<br>
                        Wishing she could die or run away never to be seen again,<br>
                        The only thing she's ever wanted is for people to understand,<br>
                        But she can only explain to you what it's like by saying,<br>
                        <br>
                        "My blade's a little bloody red,<br>
                        Tears in my eyes as I lay awakened in my bed,<br>
                        It's from all the craziness and the mistakes I've ever made,<br>
                        And now trying to love will never be the same,<br>
                        My thighs and my wrists show the misunderstandings those people gave me,<br>
                        Why say I'm perfect, then turn around and try to change me?<br>
                        I try to stop it and open up, but what I do is not enough,<br>
                        Now I'm just living in this cycle, faking smiles and acting tough."<br>
                        <br>
                        I've got nervous ticks from what myself inside my head just said,<br>
                        When I, too, was being pinned, cornered, and played by my consciousness,<br>
                        I said how can you expect others to understand you if you can't understand yourself,<br>
                        Those words were loaded into a gun and I had shot myself,<br>
                        I was face down in an underground library with only books of truth left,<br>
                        Walking my days as a stray with tunnel vision while speaking to no one else,<br>
                        Destination unknown,<br>
                        Taking giant leaps to make baby steps,<br>
                        It's come to the point where I understand not a thing except,<br>
                        <br>
                        "My blade's a little bloody red,<br>
                        Tears in my eyes as I lay awakened in my bed,<br>
                        It's from all the craziness and the mistakes I've ever made,<br>
