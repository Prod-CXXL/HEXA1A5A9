            <p>Show, performances for the mind, demonstrating art with imagination combined with determination 
                and commitment to finding the perfect way to present it all signed with the ability to give 
                sight to the blind, speak to the deaf, give life to the dead, and tell a story with clefs, 
                from pirouettes and silhouettes to marionettes and Corvettes, from a musical display of violins 
                and clarinets to your favorite actress on a television set, they all are beautiful, so take a 
                peek that you won't regret. It may only leave you with a shortness of breath that you will not 
                forget.</p>
