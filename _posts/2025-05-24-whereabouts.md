Guess who's back? My primary coding device (aka my laptop) fans gave out and were in dire need of replacement. I thought I ordered them the first time, but unfortunately I realized I didn't and had to wait more for the parts to arrive. 

In the mean time, I purchased a Pixma TS701a Printer capable of high quality printing on CDs, cards, and common paper. It can even print on the edible paper used for cakes with the proper ink and paper. I've thought abouut selling custom cards locally or even access passes to my shows when I get to that point. I did print myself an NFC business card and it turned out very well. Perhaps, I'll sell custom ones soon.

So new printer and repaired laptop.. what's next? 

I'll be revamping my site with better features and elements. so look out and prepare for a new feel.
